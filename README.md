## Lab 4

### App Description
Basic flashcard app where the user can flip the flash card back and forth to reveal and hide the answer to a question. The user can also choose between three answer choices and quiz themselves on the question as well as toggle between showing and hiding the answer choices. When the user clicks on the correct answer, it will turn green. If the user clicks on the wrong answer, the correct answer will turn green and the user's answer will turn red. Now the everytime the user opens up the app, they can open up the last saved state opening up data saved in the database. The app now has added animations when the card is clicked and when the user creates a new flashcard. When the user clicks on the correct answer choice, confetti will appear. To make it more exciting, a timer of 16 seconds is added below the card so the user is challenged to answer before the timer runs out.
